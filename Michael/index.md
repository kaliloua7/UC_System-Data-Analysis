I grew up in California and am very familiar with the UC system and the type of influence it has on Californian applicants. I am interested in comparing in state to out of state student demographics and seeing if there are any trends between the two groups. Additionally, I am interested in exploring the in state acceptance rates on a per campus basis to see if there is an overwhelming majority of accepted applicants who live in the same county as the campus or if it is harder for those students to gain acceptances into their home town UC.



I would like to explore the following to see if there are trends:



1. Instate acceptance rates in 2020
2. Compare these to previous years and investigate the relationship between test scores and the [California Resident Guarantee](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/california-residents/)
3. Gpa trends across UC campus admissions

I am also interested in looking at micro trends within the different California county applicants and seeing if its true that UCLA has a bias for non LA county residents and if UC Berkeley has a bias against east bay applicants. Looking at test scores and other demographics, I hope to see if there are any trends in geographic location and acceptances to different UC campuses.


I plan to use **Plotly** as a tool to create advanced visualizations of my dataset so that users can conduct an interactive exploration of the data easily and accessibly.

For example, in 2020 the proportion of admits stratified by county can be explored below. All counts under 50 were ignored:
