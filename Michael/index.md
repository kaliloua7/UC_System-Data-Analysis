I grew up in California and am very familiar with the UC system and the type of influence it has on Californian applicants. I am interested in comparing in state to out of state student demographics and seeing if there are any trends between the two groups. 



I would like to explore the following to see if there are trends:



1. Instate acceptance rates in 2020 and 2021
2. Compare these to previous years and investigate the relationship between test scores and the [California Resident Guarantee](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/california-residents/)
3. See if there are any trends in the out of state vs international acceptance rates after 2016 when the government severely limited J-1 Visas awarded for international student attendance in the US.



I plan to use **Plotly** as a tool to create advanced visualizations of my dataset so that users can conduct a nteractive exploration of the data easily and accessibly.
