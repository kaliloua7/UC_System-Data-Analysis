#### An investigation into the UC system's admission tactics and outcomes



---



Using Plotly visualizations, our group plans to see what trends the UC system has in their admissions data over the past few years. Each group member will investigate a different aspect of the UC admissions. 																	

The University of California has extensive records outlining the demographics of their first year admitted class dating back to 1994. Using this dataset, we can dive into over twenty years of collected data outlining the in state, out of state, and international admission [demographics](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/admissions-source-school). The UC system addressed how COVID-19 has affected the country, and claimed to have made a more equitable system for admissions. They cite relaxing ACT/SAT requirements, and eliminating excessive extra curricular demands. Using this data set, our group will explore if the UC system has any discrepancies in recent and historical admission years. 

Here is rudimentary visualization of the demographic profile of transfer applicants to the UC from Santa Monica College:

Our Team Members:

* [Michael Rubsamen](Michael) is interested in exploring the correlation between acceptance rate and home county, and whether students have a harder time being accepted into their hometown UC compared to the other campuses..

* [Kalilou Ali Kadiri](Kalilou)
* [Buddy Moench](Buddy) is interested in exploring trends in admittance demographic profiles and their relationship to official UC admittance policy. Using various online resources, including an expert witness testimonial by UC admissions consultant John Aubrey Douglass, the efficacy of policy changes will hopefully be clarified.
* [Jackson Burkhalter](Jackson) is interesting in comparing how trends in admissions by demographic between private schools and public schools differ between 2007 and 2020.
