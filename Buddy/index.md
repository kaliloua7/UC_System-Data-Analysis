I am going to endeavor to use the UC system data to describe demographic differences in the UC's admission stats across the most recent decade,
with a particular interest in the effect that inclusion or removal of admission criteria traditionally considered to reproduce existing social
inequality actually has on these demographics.

For this I will use the Freshmen ethnicity by year datasets, which are CSV files containing rows representing each student admitted, including
their ethnicity as self-reported on their application and the year they were admitted.
