I'm interested in looking at the relationship between ethnicity and admitted students to Universities of California (UCs) and how admissions have changed since 2007. I chose to start at 2007 even though the data set goes back to 1994 because then we'd be starting before the 2008 recession and move through periods of large social change.


I started by looking at the students who applied to UCs first from public schools then from private schools.

{% include_relative Visualizations/AppliedStudentsPublic.html %}



{% include_relative Visualizations/AppliedStudentsPrivate.html %}

What we can see is that the major demographics from either graph are different. While in public schools we see there are majorities in both the Asian student population and the Latino student population, the private schools have a majority in the White student population.

(I should bring up that it is hard to trust the data on the American Indian students as we will see in later graphs. In general it seems incomplete.)
